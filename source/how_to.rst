Measure which component is limiting the throughput of the coupled model
=========

Coupled performance balancing can be performed with the oasis lucia tool. In the work folder where your experiment ran, execute ``$(model_install_dir)/awicm-3.1/oasis/util/lucia/lucia``. When executing lucia for the first time, a fortran compiler needs to be available in the environment. 
The output,
   
..  code-block:: bash
  
  Component -         Calculations   -     Waiting time (s) - # cpl step :
  fesom                    1616.47                 45.08          4377
  oifs                     1263.30                397.72          4377
 
..
  
can be interpreted as such. Fesom spend nearly all it's computing time on calculations, while oifs was waiting for about 1/4 of the time. Therefore fesom was the   limiting factor on this specific setup. Take note, that having zero waiting time in all components is no achievable, since the length of timesteps varies throughout the run, depending on output and called physics packages. For example the radiation is called every 2 hours in OpenIFS making this timesteps longer than the non-radiation ones in between. Modern versions of lucia also provide solutions for optimizing with this imbalance in mind.

Generate OASIS3MCT remapping weights for large grids (offline and MPI+OMP parallel)
=========

Note: This method is meant for Atmosphere-Ocean grid combinations in excess of ~1*10^12, where automatic weight generation on single cores becomes prohibitively time consuming. 

Before you start, make sure that you:
 
- Obtain the FESOM2 mesh and generate the mesh distribution you would like to use.
- Use the `ocp-tool <https://github.com/JanStreffing/ocp-tool>`_  to match the FESOM2 mesh to the atmosphere files (really just means cutting caspian out of the OIFS land sea mask)
- Copy the ocp-tool modified OpenIFS input files, as well as the Oasis input files (areas.nc, grids.nc, masks.nc) and the runoff_mapper input files into the sub-directories of the pool dir that you use.

Steps towards the ``rmp_`` files:

- Start a coupled simulation with the desired FESOM2 mesh ``dist``. OIFS ``nproc`` may be as small as minimum memory for loading the grid demands.
- Wait until the FESOM2 mesh information was added to the ``areas.nc, grids.nc, masks.nc`` files.
- Wait until the BICUBIC remapping files have been generated. (they are much fast than the GAUSWGT ones, and this will cut the manual work in half later)
- Cancel the job allocation since generating the GAUSWGT ``rmp_`` files would take days to months.
- Change the COUPLE path in ``awicm-3.1/oasis/util/make_dir/make.${your_config}_``
- Set the path to ${your_config} in ``awicm-3.1/oasis/util/make_dir/make.inc_``
- Go to ``awicm-3.1/oasis/examples/test_interpolation``
- Add your ``areas.nc, grids.nc, masks.nc`` files to ``awicm-3.1/oasis/examples/test_interpolation/data_frontiers``
- Modify the ``awicm-3.1/oasis/examples/test_interpolation/run_frontiersinterp.sh`` to add your machine, if it's not included already.
-  Extract the first of the ``GAUSWGT`` couplings (FESOM->OIFS) from the namcouple in your work folder where you generated the ``BICUBIC`` ``rmp_`` files.
- Create a namcouple containing only this one remapping in ``awicm-3.1/oasis/examples/test_interpolation/data_frontiers`` For an example, see: ``awicm-3.1/oasis/examples/test_interpolation/data_frontiers/namcouple_feom_A160_gauswgt``
- Configure `awicm-3.1/oasis/examples/test_interpolation/run_frontiersinterp.sh` to generate this remapping with OpenMP parallelization.
- Generate the first GAUSWGT remapping by starting ``run_frontiersinterp.sh`` on the batch queue.
- Go to Step 9 and repeat for second ``GAUSWGT`` remapping (Runoff-mapper -> FESOM).
- Copy all ``rmp_`` files into the respective pool dir folder (e.g. ``input/oasis/cy43r3/{OIFS_RES}-${FESOM_RES}/${FESOM_DIST}``).
- Start a coupled simulation.

CMIP6
---------
Control is possible through the namelist file fort.4. Inside you will find the namelist NAERAD, which contains the options for CMIP5 and CMIP6 greenhouse gas forcing. To activate CMIP6 forcing set the logic switch ``LCMIP6 = .true.``. When NCMIPFIXYR is set to a value >0, it is interpreted as a fix forcing year. In the example below we use constant 1850 GHG forcing. If NCMIPFIXYR=0 the actual model year is used, and forcing changes from year to year. Note, that currently only greenhouse gases and solar radiation are set through this namelist. Work on the implementation of controllable anthopogenic aerosols is still ongoing (status: 30th of June 2022).

.. code-block:: Fortran
   
   &NAERAD
      LCMIP6 = .true.
      CMIP6DATADIR = 'PATH_TO_CMIP6_POOL'
      NCMIPFIXYR = 1850
      SSPNAME = 'historical'
      
Historic forcing is available for the years 1850 to 2014.
      
.. code-block:: Fortran
   
   &NAERAD
      LCMIP6 = .true.
      CMIP6DATADIR = 'PATH_TO_CMIP6_POOL'
      NCMIPFIXYR = 0
      SSPNAME = 'historical'
      
Available SSPs are: ``SSP1-1.9``, ``SSP1-2.6``, ``SSP2-4.5``, ``SSP3-7.0``, ``SSP3-LowNTCF``, ``SSP4-3.4``, ``SSP4-6.0``, ``SSP4-6.0``, ``SSP5-3.4-OS``, ``SSP5-8.5``. Covered years are 2015 to 2100.

.. code-block:: Fortran
   
   &NAERAD
      LCMIP6 = .true.
      CMIP6DATADIR = 'PATH_TO_CMIP6_POOL'
      NCMIPFIXYR = 0
      SSPNAME = 'SSP3-7.0'

The model also supports one percent increase per year and sudden four times incease of CO2 experiments through the additional logic switches ``L1PCTCO2`` and ``LA4XCO2``. The base value from which the the increase starts is set via ``NCMIPFIXYR``.

.. code-block:: Fortran
   
   &NAERAD
      LCMIP6 = .true.
      CMIP6DATADIR = 'PATH_TO_CMIP6_POOL'
      NCMIPFIXYR = 1850
      SSPNAME = 'historical'
      L1PCTCO2 = 'true'
      
For a more detailed look at the use of these forcing consult the source code file ``src/ifs/climate/updrgas.F90``

CMIP5
--------
Control is analogous to CMIP6 but we use ``LCMIP5``, ``CMIP5DATADIR``, and ``NRCP`` instead. Avaiable RCP are: 

.. code-block:: Fortran

    SELECT CASE (NRCP)
    CASE (0)
      FILENAME='ghg_histo.txt'
    CASE (1)
      FILENAME='ghg_rcp3PD.txt'
    CASE (2)
      FILENAME='ghg_rcp45.txt'
    CASE (3)
      FILENAME='ghg_rcp60.txt'
    CASE (4)
      FILENAME='ghg_rcp85.txt'

For a more detailed look at the use of these forcing consult the source code file ``src/ifs/climate/updrgas.F90``

Change the number of vertical levels for pressure level output of OpenIFS
=========
Output in controlled via `XIOS <https://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/ioserver>`_. The pressure levels onto which the data is interpolated from model levels is set in ``axis_def.xml``. In principle two options exist. Changing the number of levels for all 3D pressue level output fields and changing the number of levels only for some output fields.

For all fields
---------

To change the number of layers for all 3D pressure level fields, in ``axis_def.xml`` in section ``<axis_group id="pl_axes" ...>``
modify ``n_glo="19"`` to the new number of layers, ``value="(0,18)`` to 0 nlayers-1 and subequently list the pressure levels in Pa.

For select fields
---------

For selective fitting, in the ``<axis id="pressure_levels_zoom"`` section, you can make a sub-selection of the levels previously defined in the ``<axis id="pressure_levels"`` section. In the existing example three layers are selected: ``<zoom_axis index="(0,2)[10 11 12]" />``. To write a field on this reduced vertical domain you have to define a new grid in ``grid_def.xml``, specifying as domain ``pressure_levels_zoom`` instead of ``pressure_levels``. With this new grid you go to ``file_def.xml`` and define a new file (copy paste from ``pressure level`` output to ``pressure level output zoom``, and select the new grid). Then you delete the variables that should not be written on all levels from the pressure level output and insert them at pressure level output zoom.

Control orbital parameters
=========

The orbital parameters (eccentricity, obliquity, and longitude of perihelion) can be controlled through the namelist ``NAMORB`` inside the ``fort.4`` file. For details of the implementation, consider looking at yomorb.F90 and su0phy.F90.  Controllable orbital parameters are turned on with the logic swtich: ``LCORBMD=true``, which is turned off by default. There are then three modes with which the orbital parameters can be controlled.

- Under ``ORBMODE=variable_year`` mode the orbital parameters are calculated according to Berger et al. 1978 for the current year of the simulation. This is the default. The calculation can be considered reliable within ~+-1 million years of the present.
- Under ``ORBMODE=fixed_year`` mode the orbital parameters are calculated according to Berger et al. 1978 for the fixed year set by the namelist variable ``ORBIY``. If you choose fixed year but set no year, the default is 1950.
- Under ``fixed_parameters`` you have manual control over the parameters ``ORBECCEN``, ``ORBOBLIQ`` and ``ORBMVELP``. If you choose fixed parameters but set no parameters, the default ones are for 1950.

Example for manual control:

.. code-block:: Fortran

   &NAMORB
      LCORBMD = true
      ORBMODE = 'fixed_parameters'
      ORBECCEN = 0.016715
      ORBOBLIQ = 23.4441
      ORBMVELP = 102.7
      

In order to have esm-tools create an openIFS namelist of that form one can adjust the simulation YAML. The following example would let openIFS compute top of the atmosphere insolation based on an LIG orbit whose parameters are as defined for PMIP4:

.. code-block:: yaml

   oifs:
       add_namelist_changes:
           fort.4:
               NAMORB:
                   LCORBMD: TRUE
                   ORBMODE: 'fixed_parameters'
                   ORBECCEN: 0.039378
                   ORBOBLIQ: 24.040
                   ORBMVELP: 275.41

The resulting anomaly of top of the atmosphere insolation shows the expected anomalies across latitudes over time:
